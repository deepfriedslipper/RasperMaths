      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p class="mt-3">
        Our team of students came together to create Rasper Maths with a clear vision: to address the problems
        we faced with existing homework platforms. We recognized the prevalence of gimmicks, high prices, and other
        anti-consumer practices that often hindered students' learning experience.
        <br><br>
        Our team, consisting of students themselves, have firsthand experience with the homework platforms available
        today, and
        we have used our insights to design a platform that is enjoyable, engaging, and productive. We believe that when
        students enjoy the process of learning, they are more likely to be engaged, and hence motivated to complete
        their assignments.
        <br><br>
        Powered by state-of-the-art AI technology, Rasper Maths offers a comprehensive array of features that are
        designed to support students of all capabilities. Whether you're a math whiz or struggling with complex
        concepts, our platform provides the tools and resources you need to succeed. From step-by-step solutions to
        practice problems, interactive tutorials, and personalized feedback, we have it all.
        <br><br>
        One of our core values at Rasper Maths is affordability. We strive to make our platform accessible to all
        students by offering fair and transparent pricing options. We understand the financial constraints that many
        students face, and we believe that quality math homework assistance should not break the bank.
        <br><br>
        Rasper Maths also focuses on providing a comprehensive and effective learning experience. Our platform offers a
        wide range of maths topics and concepts, with detailed explanations and examples to help students understand the
        material thoroughly. We also provide interactive features, such as practice exercises and quizzes, to reinforce
        learning and allow students to track their progress.
        <br><br>
        We are committed to creating a safe and secure environment for students to learn and grow. Our platform
        prioritizes user privacy and data security, ensuring that all personal information is protected.
        <br><br>
        We are proud to offer Rasper Maths as a solution to the issues that many students face with
        homework platforms. Our goal is to empower students to excel in their studies by providing an enjoyable,
        affordable, and effective learning experience.
