REFLECTION

Hello, and welcome back to RasperMaths. I'm Mr Goddard, and in this video, we are going to be discussing Reflection, which is part of the Transformations topic.

Reflection is the process of flipping an object over a line, known as the mirror line or axis. The resulting image is the mirror image of the original object.
To reflect an object over a line, you need to follow a few simple steps. Let's take a look at a couple of examples.

Here's a shape that we need to reflect over the line. The line is called the mirror axis.

First, draw the mirror line or axis. It could be a vertical or horizontal line, or any other line in between.
Next, mark a few points on the object and their corresponding points on the other side of the mirror line.
Finally, connect the corresponding points on either side of the mirror line and draw the reflected image.

Let's take another example.

This time, we have to reflect a shape over the line.

Again, draw the mirror line or axis.
Next, mark a few points on the object and their corresponding points on the other side of the mirror line.
Finally, connect the corresponding points on either side of the mirror line and draw the reflected image.

Great job! You now know how to reflect objects over a line or axis. 

Thank you for watching, and I'll see you in the next video.
