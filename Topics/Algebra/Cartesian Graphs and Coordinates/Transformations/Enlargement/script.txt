ENLARGEMENT

Hello, and welcome back to RasperMaths. I'm Mr Goddard and in this video, we are going to be discussing Enlargement, which is part of the Transformations topic.

The center of enlargement is where the shape will enlarge from. This is what a centre of enlargement looks like in the corner, and in the center.
