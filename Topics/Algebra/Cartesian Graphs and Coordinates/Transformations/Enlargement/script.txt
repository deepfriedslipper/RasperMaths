ENLARGEMENT

Hello, and welcome back to RasperMaths. I'm Mr Goddard and in this video, we are going to be discussing Enlargement, which is part of the Transformations topic.

The first thing I'd like you to understand is that there are 2 factors that we need to calculate to enlarge a shape; the Scale Factor, and the Centre of Enlargement.

The center of enlargement is where the shape will enlarge from. This is what a centre of enlargement looks like in the corner, and in the center.

The scale factor is fairly self-explanatory; this is how much you are enlarging the shape by. A scale factor of 2 looks like this. All the sides have doubled in length. Essentially, you multiply the lengths of all the sides by the scale factor to get the new side lengths.

Let's have a look at some example problems and solve them together.

What is the scale factor of this enlargement if it began with sides of 2 cm and ended with sides of 14cm?

We can write this as an equation: 2 times x is 14. We can then rearrange this equation to give us 14 divided by 2 is x.
14 divided by 2 we know is 7, thus the scale factor in this example is 7.

If this shape is enlarged with a scale factor of 4, what is its final area?

First of all, we multiply all of the side lengths by the scale factor which is 4.

Then we can calculate the area, which we know to be base times by height divided by 2. If we rotate the shape we can see we have a right angle here which means we can use this as the base and this as the height.
6 times 8 is 48, which we can divide by 2 to get 24 cm squared.
